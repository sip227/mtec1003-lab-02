This lab will review downloading and uncompressing files, and it will get us set up for the remainder of the labs.
==========
==========
1. Go to your home directory.

Write the command that you used to do this below:
----------

cd ~

==========
2. Prove that you're in your home directory.

Write the command that you used to do this - as well as its output - below :

==========
3. Create a new directory inside your home directory named after this class. Call it "mtec1003".

Write the command that you used to do this:
----------
mkdir mtec1003

==========
4.  A compressed archive (.tar.gz) of some lab files we're using today lives at this url: 

http://einbahnstrasse.github.io/Goldford-MTEC1003-Fall2020/labs/03/mtec1003-lab-02.tar.gz mtec1003-lab-02.tar.gz

Using a Terminal command that we learned, 
download this file to your home directory into a file called mtec1003-lab-02.tar.gz

This command should have a *flag* to specify the output file.
MAKE SURE TO NAME YOUR OUTPUT FILE: mtec1003-lab-02.tar.gz

Write the command(s) that you used to download this file:
----------

curl -o http://einbahnstrasse.github.io/Goldford-MTEC1003-Fall2020/labs/03/mtec1003-lab-02.tar.gz 


==========
5.  Uncompress the file that you just downloaded. (Remember which command to use for this type of archive...)

Write the command(s) that you used to do this - as well as its output - below:
----------
tar -xvf mtec1003-lab-03.tar.gz





==========
6.  You should now have a directory called mtec1003-lab-02 inside your mtec1003 directory, 
which is inside your home directory. Verify that this directory exists.

If the directory does not exist, start over from step #1.

Otherwise...

Write the command(s) that you used to do this - as well as its output - below:
----------
ls -l

lab.02.part1.review.compress.txt	mtec1003-lab-03
lab.02.part2.working.with.files.txt	mtec1003-lab-03.tar.gz
lab.02.part3.shell.scripting.txt






==========
7.  What directories are in the mtec1003-lab-02 folder?

Write the command(s) that you used to determine this - as well as its output - below:
----------

ls mtec1003-lab-03

books	logs	web




==========
8.  Go back to your home directory. Then change to the science-fiction directory using a relative path.  The directory is located in books... which is located in the mtec1003-lab-02 directory.  Verify you're in the right directory using pwd.

Write the commands, including going home, that you used to do this:
----------
cd ~
cd myClasses_FALL2020/mtec1003/week2/mtec1003-lab-03/books/science-fiction
pwd

cd /Users/faithfulwater/myClasses_FALL2020/mtec1003/week2/mtec1003-lab-03/books/science-fiction
pwd



==========
11. Find out what the most recently modified directory is in mtec1003-lab-02. 
How would you find this out?
Hint: perhaps use something to show the modified date... and sort it by time...

*Also, be sure to cd into your mtec1003-lab-02 folder first!

Write the command(s) that you used to do this below:
----------


ls -lt 




==========
12. Create a compressed archive of the logs folder: 
that is, take the contents of logs and create a single archive (.tar), and compress (.gz)

----------

tar -cvf logs.tar.gz /Users/faithfulwater/myClasses_FALL2020/mtec1003
